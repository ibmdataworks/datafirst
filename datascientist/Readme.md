As a Data Scientist, you have to turn raw data into meaning using state-of-the-art techniques leveraging open source and enterprise applications. Perform hands-on exercises leveraging Apache Spark, Jupyter, Python, and R to derive sales performance for a specific product line, then build an advanced Machine Learning model in R.

##Welcome to IBM Data Science Experience (DSX) - datascience.ibm.com

IBM Data Science Experience (DSX) is the premier offering that seamlessly allows data scientists and data engineers to connect data from multiple domains, to analyze it, and visually to explore the data for insights. The solutions that were not possible previously or required months of development effort can now be done in DSX in a very fast and intuitive manner.

R has become the de-facto standard in the domain of data science: it supports multiple machine learning algorithms and ability to visualize the outcomes of the research.

DSX brings together the data science development experience accumulated in R, Python, Scala, and Java, intuitive data connectivity and processing capabilities of Spark, and the state-of-art dynamic visualization technology using Brunel, Pixiedust, and RStudio.

#Step 1. Get on IBM Data Science Experience (DSX)...

Before you start, you’ll need a Bluemix account. If you don’t have a Bluemix account, follow the steps to create one [here]( https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/).

Once you fill out the form to sign up, check your email for an activation code. Once you have the activation code, you can complete the Bluemix sign up process. Now that you have a Bluemix account, you can login from the [DSX landing page]( http://datascience.ibm.com/).

If you have a Bluemix account, click the Log In button on the DSX landing page to sign in with your Bluemix credentials. Type in your Bluemix email address and password, then click Sign In.

You are now in the Data Science Experience. Depending on the plan you chose, your environment is automatically set up with at least one Apache Spark instance and at least 5 GB of object storage.
From here you can create a new project, notebook, or connection. You can also explore any of the tutorials, videos, sample notebooks or articles in the community.

#Step 2. Perform Hands on Exercises.

##[Part 1. Root Cause Analysis (Interactive Analytics) Start Here](https://github.com/ibmdataworks/datafirst/raw/master/datascientist/interactive-analytics/)
This lab exercise uses an IPython Notebook in DSX to connect with dashDB, explores sales, product data and analyze sales performance for a specific product line. Pixiedust, a Python based visualization package is used to visualize the results.

##[Part 2. Create Resolution (Machine Learning) Start Here](https://github.com/ibmdataworks/datafirst/raw/master/datascientist/machinelearning/)
This lab we will explore how a data scientist utilizes DSX and IBM Bluemix cloud services to easily analyze data using machine learning techniques and to visualize the outcomes using DSX, R, and Brunel. For the lab, we have chosen two algorithms to demonstrate supervised and unsupervised machine learning in DSX. Decision tree-based classification is one of the domains that allowed scientists to have direct insights into the reasoning behind classification choices. Association rules algorithms support market basket analysis.
